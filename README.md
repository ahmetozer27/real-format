**Description:**  
This program performs a secure, irreversible cleanup by filling all empty spaces with zeros (`\x00`), ensuring that sensitive data is thoroughly erased and cannot be recovered. It effectively wipes memory or files, providing enhanced security for data deletion by overwriting unallocated space with `\x00`. This approach ensures that previously stored data cannot be reconstructed, making it suitable for highly secure data disposal.

**Technical Details:**  
- The program fills all empty spaces in the memory or file with `\x00` bytes.
- This overwriting process ensures that no residual data remains, effectively rendering the original information unrecoverable.
- The cleanup is irreversible, preventing any possibility of data recovery using traditional or advanced recovery methods.
